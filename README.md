## Developement Tools

In Visual Studio Code, please install `Sass` and `Live Sass Complier` since we're using SCSS and so that we don't need to restart every time we make changes to the code.

Also Include `Live Server` Extension to be able to launch the development server locally.

`HTML Snippets` and `HTML CSS Support` are also helpful and recommended for this project.
